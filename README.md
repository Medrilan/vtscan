Simple powershell script to call the Virus Total API and check a file has for reported malicious behavior. 

This script will accept an API Key for Virus Total as well as an MD5 or SHA256 hash value. It will then call on the Virus Total API and return the number of malicious reports on the hash.

There are two versions of the script present. The one ending in "inprogress" is currently non functional. The file description elaborates on planned imrovements yet to be implemented.
